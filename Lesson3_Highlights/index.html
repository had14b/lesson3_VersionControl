            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Version control is a system that keeps track of the revisions or versions of files over time. If you are an app developer and want to keep track of every version of the application you have created, a Version Control System (VCS) would be a helpful tool. If you add new lines of code and all of the sudden there is a bug, you can easily revert back to the previous working version of the application. It is also a good system to use if you are working with a team. You can see what other people are contributing and how it should be implemented into the new version.</p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">In the early 2000's, Linux kernel developers did not have a good system for version control. They just independently released patches and archived files. It was not until 2002, that Linux developers teamed up up with BitKeeper in order to use their proprietary distributed version control system. But in 2005, BitKeeper and Linux were forced to split ways when BitKeeper ceased to be a free service. Linux was still in need of a version control system, however. So that same year, Linux created a system that was fast, simple in design, fully distributed, able to handle large projects with ease, and supported non-linear development. This system is now known as Git.</p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Files in Git have three possible states that they can be in. They can be committed, modified, or staged.When a file is committed, it means that it is securely stored on your local system. When it is in the modified state, it means that the file is being modified or changed but not yet committed to the local system. When a file is staged, it means that the file has been marked to be committed. The whole process is pretty simple. First you modify your files and then add them to your staging area. When you are ready to make all of the changes permanent, you do a commit to save everything to the Git directory.</p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">If you want to contribute to an existing project on Git, you need to run the command git clone. The syntax of the code is as follows: $ git clone [URL] [optional target directory name]. The image above graphically illustrates a git clone command. Git will retrieve a full copy of the project files. When you run git clone, by default, all the versions of the files are retrieved. This is actually a good way to back up your projects. You can clone the files on another server. If the original files get lost or corrupted, you can restore the project to the previous state using the clone.</p>

                <span class="text-muted">Checking File Status</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Checking the status of your files is easy to do in Git. You can find out what state your files are in by running the git status command in the terminal. You get this message if you run the command right after running the clone command (see example above). This message lets you know that you have a clean working directory. This means that none of your tracked files are modified. There are also no untracked files found. If so, they would be listed there. It will also inform you which branch you are on and let you know that it has not changed branches on the server. The current branch will always be "master" by default.</p>
